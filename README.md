Node-Particles
====================

This repository provides a simple, programatic API to define a particle system in Javascript and use it in your NodeJs project (i.e. as a backend library).

The base functionality has been forked from [JavaScript-Particle-System](http://jsoverson.github.com/JavaScript-Particle-System/) so if you are looking for a particle system for the browser that's the place to go.
There is also a very nice article from the same author [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/hub/blogs/build-a-javascript-particle-system-in-200-lines#).

## Usage
The easiest way of using the library is by means of np:m  
```bash
npm install node-particles
```
Then from your scripts you can consume it using require:
```js
var ns = require ("node-particles")
```
