Node-Particles
====================

This repository provides a simple, programatic API to define a particle system in Javascript and use it in your NodeJs project (i.e. as a backend library).

The base functionality has been forked from [JavaScript-Particle-System](http://jsoverson.github.com/JavaScript-Particle-System/) so if you are looking for a particle system for the browser that's the place to go.
